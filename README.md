## Overview
### Description
Basically allows users to connect to new people and Buy/ Sell stuff. User can also report corrupt posts/users, review their experience or could just post pictures.  
Could be potentially as a common platform to connect with new people as well as buy/sell stuff.

### App Evaluation
- **Category:** Social Networking / Digital Market
- **Mobile:** This app would be primarily developed for Ios devices.
- **Story:** Analyzes users location , and connects them to nearby users and available posts to Buy and also allow USer to put up stuff to sell. The user can then decide to message this person/ post if wanted.
- **Market:** Any individual could choose to use this app, and to keep it a safe environment, people would be organized into age groups.
- **Habit:** This app could be used as often or unoften as the user wanted depending on their needs and social life, and what exactly they're looking for.
- **Scope:** First we would start with suggesting people/ posts based on location and user preference, then perhaps this could evolve into a sharing application to broaden its usage. Large potential for use with ability to view and review posts from eBay, Facebook, or digital selling/buying applications.
